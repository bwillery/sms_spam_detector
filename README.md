SMS Text Classification with Gradio
This project implements a machine learning pipeline for classifying SMS messages into categories (e.g., spam or non-spam) using the following tools:

TF-IDF Vectorization for text feature extraction
Linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) for classification
Gradio for creating an interactive web interface to test the classification.

Features
SMS Classification: Classifies SMS text messages into predefined categories using machine learning.
Interactive Interface: Users can interact with the model using a web-based interface provided by Gradio.

Usage
Prepare your SMS dataset: The dataset should be a CSV file with at least two columns:

text_message: The actual SMS content.
label: The category or label for each SMS (e.g., spam, ham).
Running the model: Open the provided Jupyter Notebook and follow the steps to load your dataset, train the model, and launch the Gradio interface.

Testing the model: After running the notebook, a Gradio web interface will be created where you can input custom SMS messages and classify them in real time.

How it Works
The pipeline includes:

TF-IDF Vectorizer: Converts SMS messages into numerical representations.
LinearSVC: A linear Support Vector Machine model for classification.
The model is trained on a dataset of SMS messages, and Gradio provides a simple interface to test predictions.
